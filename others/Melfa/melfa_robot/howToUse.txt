a. Set robot contoroller parameter
  NETIP   : 192.168.0.20
  NETPORT : 10000,10001,....,10009
  MXTTOUT : -1

b. Make Robot Program in the Robot Controller
name:MXTSAMPLE
----------------------------------
Open "ENET:192.168.0.2" As #1
Mov P1
Mxt 1,1,50
Mov P1
Hlt
-----------------------------------
You have to define the position "P1" as initial position.
 And set PC's IP : 192.168.0.2
If you want to move the robot in POSITION reference,
you have to set MXT command like
Mxt 1,0,50
second argument is corresponding like following:
0: position  1:joint 2:moter pluse
and third argument is filter time constant.
0 means the use of no filtered reference.


c. Connect the robot controller and PC with Ethernet cable.
It is better to confirm the conneciton with the robot controller
by useing "ping 192.168.0.20".
 
d.Set the robot Automatic mode, and run above program MXTSAMPLE.
(The robot will move to P1 position, and wait the reference
from the PC.  <- Mxt command )


1.compile
g++ -o MXTSample.out linuxSample.cpp
 
2. type
./MXTSample.out

3.  Input connection destination IP address (192.168.0.20) ->
 Enter Robot Controller's IP address(same to NETIP value).

4.  Input connection destination port No. (10000) -> 
 push Enter (10000 is O.K.)

5.  Use input/output signal?([Y] / [N])-> 
Robot controller has some type of Input Output signals.
please refer the manual "bfp-a8896n " p.339 or p.350.

If you choose Y , you can see the condition of input signal and
set output signal by setting head bit No, bit mask and bit data.

Usually, type n or hit Enter.

6. â—‹ --- Input the data type of command. --- 
  [0: None / 1: XYZ / 2:JOINT / 3: PULSE]
  -- please input the number -- [0] - [3]->

Choose reference type. but you have to chooe the same one
which is selected in the robot program command MXT.
For exampe, if you wrote
MXT 1,0,50
in the robot program that is running now,
you have to choose 1:XYZ .
wrong choice cause alert from robot controller.

7. --- input the data type of monitor ( %d-th ) ---  4times loop
    [0: None]
    [1: XYZ / 2:JOINT / 3: PULSE] Command value
    [4: XYZ/ 5: JOINT/ 6: PULSE] Command value after the filter process
    [7: XYZ/ 8:JOINT/ 9:PULSE] Feedback value.
    [10: Electric current value / 11: Electric current feedback] ... Electric
    current value.
    Input the numeral [0] to [11] ->

You can choose 4e information that are reported from robot controller at once.
1,2,3,10 is reference value, and 4, 5, 6 is filtered value.
filter is setted by MXT command in the robot program.
7,8,9,11 is present value.

8.IP=192.168.0.20 / PORT=10000 / Send Type=0 / Monitor Type0/1/2/3=0/0/0/0
 [g]= End MXT mode / [d]= Monitor data display 
   [0/1/2/3]= Change of monitor data display 
 [z/x]= Inc/Dec 1st command(X/J1/p1) by the delta amount. 
 [a/s]= Inc/Dec 2nd command(Y/J2/p2) by the delta amount. 
 [q/w]= Inc/Dec 3rd command(Z/J3/p3) by the delta amount. 
 [c]= [CAUTION! Move Very quick!!] Return to initial position. 
  Is it all right? [Enter:Start MXT] / [Ctrl+C:Abort] :

Please check the settings you enterd.
If you think all right, plase hit Enter key.

In you can move the robot position with z,x,a,s,q,w key. 

The robot moves to initial position with c key, However be careful!,
the robot will move very quickly!

Information of the robot is displayed with d key. addtional hit of d key
hide the informatin. and a hit of 0/1/2/3 changes the type of the informatin.

typing g key finish this program, and send a End MXT Command to
the robot controller. Then, control is moved to the robot controller and
the robot move to P1 positon (Mov P1), stop(Hlt).




- If you can not communicate with the robot controller,
a. please check Firewall setteng.
b. If you are connectiong PC and robot controller directly with a cable,
please check that calbe is cross type. However recent Ethernet interface
that supprt AutoMDI/MDI-X dose not be affected by cross/straight.
